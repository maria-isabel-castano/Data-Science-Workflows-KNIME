# 📊 Data Science & ETL Workflows (KNIME)

This repository contains professional workflows developed in **KNIME Analytics Platform**. These projects demonstrate my ability to process, transform, and analyze data using a visual programming approach.

## 🚀 Featured Workflows

### 1. [Predictive Modeling: Student Mental Health Analysis]
**Objective:** Developed a predictive workflow to identify potential cases of depression in students based on behavioral and academic indicators.
- *Key Stages of the Workflow:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized numerical features, and applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified key correlations between lifestyle factors and mental health outcomes.
3. **Model Training:** Implemented a **Logistic Regression** algorithm, partitioning the data (70/30) for robust training and testing.
4. **Evaluation:** Achieved an 84.5% accuracy rate, validated through Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve analysis.

**Technical Insight:** Even though the project used a synthetic dataset for architectural testing, the workflow is fully scalable and ready to be deployed with real-world institutional data.
